# GapJumpers

[https://gapjumpers-web-design.web.app/](Final Solution)

A blind audition from a company called GapJumpers.com. 

The audition involved taking CSV file and formatting it in a way which visually represented the differences between men & women applying for job roles. The task specifically asked to compare how far each person went in the application process based on their gender.

I was given three days to complete this task and felt like I did good job. By converting the CSV file to JSON format, I was able to store it in a Firebase backend. I used Angular for the frontend as I'm familiar with the framework, and given the short time I had to work on the task, I didn't make sense to go with something which I was unfamiliar with.

After the data was in Firebase, I connected my Angular app to the backend to pull through the data. I had manipulate the data a but in order to retrieve relevent totals which could be used in the graphs.

I used bootstrap progress bars to display the difference between how many men and women had applied for each role. To display how far each person went in the application process I used Chart.js. I used Chart.js because of the tight deadline. As I'm familiar with the library, I was confident it was fit for purpose. 

After comparing the data from the original CSV file, I was confident the graphs were displaying accurate data and delivered the solution on time.
